# ----Self-Driving Car Project----

### Setup
This is my Raspberry Pi Project. To setup the car, go to this [link](https://github.com/sunfounder/picar-4wd) and clone it to the Raspberry Pi system. The folder location should be `home/pi/picar-4wd`. Then, run `python3 setup.py install` to install all necessary packages. 

*Note: If Raspberry Pi system has installed Anaconda/miniconda/miniforge, the picar_4wd module will not work*.
